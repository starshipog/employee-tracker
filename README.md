# <Employee-Tracker>

## Description


My motivation was to create an application that helps with organization.
I built this project to help businesses keep their employees and any information about them organized and easy to find.
This solves the problem of having a hard time finding an employee, their role or department due to lack of organization.
I learned how to use schema to build an employee database
